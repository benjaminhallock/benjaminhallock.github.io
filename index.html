    <p>My name is Ben Hallock (duh), I was born in Spring Valley, Illinois on Monday, June 21st 1993, I was a large headed child; constantly falling on my head, which only reinforced my large cranium. Please don't use any of this personal information to answer my online security questions. I am a super junior at Aurora University, studying Computer Science. This is my second time studying computer science, I dropped out of SIU:C film school to pursue programming in Chicago at the now deceased Mobile Makers Academy run by legendary Don Bora, and creator of Homebrew, Max Howell (@mxcl). I am a huge fan of of the native Chicago band, Fall Out Boy (concert shown below), I like to cook and hike, I have a white siberian husky named Luna at home, and I currently live with two cats Nova & Aurora and my girlfriend Alexis, in downtown Aurora. I'm currently pursuing a career in software development, and I'm looking for an internship for the summer of 2022. I'm currently experimenting with Stable Diffusion and other generative art techniques, and I'm writing half of this description with AI assistant Github Copilot. rawrXDttylkthxbye<3</p>
